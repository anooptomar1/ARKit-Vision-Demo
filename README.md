# ARKit-Vision-Demo
Simple demo app that uses the Vision API and ARKit.

Uses Vision to detect a face and then use ARKit to place a node at the site of the face.

Put this demo on here because I was having a hard time myself figuring out how to get a frame to Vision to process it for a face. Hope this helps someone else or at least points you in the right direction.
